## Introduction to PyTorch

PyTorch is a widely-used deep learning framework developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It provides a flexible and dynamic computational graph, making it popular among researchers and practitioners for tasks such as neural networks, natural language processing, computer vision, and more. PyTorch combines a simple and intuitive interface with powerful capabilities for building and training deep learning models.

## Getting Started

If you're new to PyTorch, here are some steps to get started:

1. **Installation**: Install PyTorch using the installation instructions provided on the [official PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/). You can install PyTorch via pip or conda, depending on your preference and system setup.

2. **Tutorials**: Explore the official PyTorch tutorials to learn the basics and get familiar with PyTorch's features and capabilities. The [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) is an excellent resource for tutorials, guides, and API documentation.

3. **Hands-on Projects**: Start building your own projects and experiments using PyTorch. This repository provides various examples and projects to help you apply what you've learned in practice.
